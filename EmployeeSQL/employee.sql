--As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. 
--You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. 
--To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:


--Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) 
--This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. 
--Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:
